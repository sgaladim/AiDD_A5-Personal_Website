Assignment 5: Personal Webpage Showcase
(AI-Integrated Version)
ðŸŽ¯ Objective
Create a personal webpage that showcases your skills, interests, and accomplishments. The webpage should be visually appealing, informative, and demonstrate your proficiency in HTML, CSS, and basic web design. You will also practice AI-assisted development using tools like GitHub Copilot or Cursor while maintaining critical oversight and reflection.
This assignment emphasizes both technical competence and responsible use of AI tools in modern software development.

Step 1: Planning
Before coding, plan your personal webpage. - Purpose: What is the main purpose of your webpage? (Portfolio, resume, blog, or combination?) - Content: What information will you include? (Bio, resume, projects, hobbies, contact info.) - Design: Choose a color scheme, fonts, and layout that reflect your personality and purpose. - AI Setup: Ensure you have GitHub Copilot or Cursor enabled. Be ready to log AI prompts in a .prompt/dev_notes.md file.

Step 2: Creating the Webpages
Your site should be a multi-page website with consistent navigation.
Homepage (index.html)
â€¢	Title, header, and a short introduction about yourself.
â€¢	Navigation links to other sections (About Me, Resume, Projects, Contact).
About Me (about.html)
â€¢	A detailed biography: background, interests, and goals.
â€¢	A photo of yourself stored in an /images subdirectory.
Resume (resume.html)
â€¢	Include your resume or CV with sections like education, experience, skills, and achievements.
â€¢	Embed as formatted HTML, PDF, or an image.
Projects (projects.html)
â€¢	Showcase at least two projects.
â€¢	Include descriptions, screenshots/images, and links to live demos or repositories.
Contact (contact.html)
â€¢	Provide contact info (email, LinkedIn, GitHub).
â€¢	Include a contact form (see Step 4).

Step 3: Styling and Layout
â€¢	Use a separate CSS file (styles.css) linked from each HTML page.
â€¢	Ensure consistent fonts, colors, and layout across pages.
â€¢	Make your site responsive so it works on desktop and mobile.
â€¢	Use semantic HTML (<header>, <nav>, <main>, <footer>) for structure.

Step 4: Form Page
Add a form on the contact.html page. - Fields: - First Name (required) - Last Name (required) - Email Address (required, valid format) - Password (required, min 8 characters) - Confirm Password (required, must match Password) - Use attributes: required, type, pattern, minlength. - Show clear error messages (using HTML or minimal JavaScript). - Redirect to a Thank You page (thankyou.html) after submission. - Accessibility requirement: All inputs must have labels connected with for and id. Add alt text for any images.

Step 5: AI Prompts and Reflection
Since this is an AI-first course, you must: - Create a .prompt/dev_notes.md file in your repo. - Log at least 3 prompts you used with Copilot, Cursor, or another AI IDE. - Include: 1. The prompt you wrote 2. The AI output 3. A note on whether you accepted, modified, or rejected the output - Write a 150-word reflection in the same file: - Where AI helped you save time - Where AI made mistakes - How you balanced AI assistance with your own coding
________________________________________
Step 6: Final Touches
â€¢	Test your site in at least two browsers.
â€¢	Validate your HTML and CSS.
â€¢	Ensure navigation works across all pages.
â€¢	Commit and push your code frequently.
________________________________________
Step 7: Submission
1.	Zip all project files (HTML, CSS, images, .prompt/dev_notes.md).
2.	Submit the .zip file on Canvas.
3.	Ensure your repo is also pushed to GitHub and shared with your instructor + GA.
a.	Include a link to your GitHub Repo in your HTML website submitted to Canvas

ðŸ“Š Grading Rubric
â€¢	Content Quality (20%) â€” meaningful biography, resume, projects, and contact info
â€¢	Design & Layout (20%) â€” consistent styling, responsiveness, accessibility
â€¢	Technical Correctness (20%) â€” valid HTML/CSS, working navigation, functional form

â€¢	Professionalism (20%) â€” clean repo, organization, and attention to detail
________________________________________
ðŸ’¡ Tips for Success
â€¢	Donâ€™t let AI do all the work. Use it for scaffolding, but add your own content and styling choices.
â€¢	Make your site feel like you. This is both a technical project and a creative expression.
â€¢	Debugging AI mistakes is part of the assignment. Document when AI gets things wrong.
â€¢	Look at your site on your phone â€” does it still look good?
